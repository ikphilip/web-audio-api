multiple-audio-sources
================

This branch demonstrates that the (multiple)channels of a stereo audio stream can be piped into a single channel output in the web browser.

There is also a demonstration of the DOM being used to manipulate and control the output using the Web Audio API.

violent-theremin
================

Violent theremin uses the Web Audio API to generate sound, and HTML5 canvas for a bit of pretty visualization. The colours generated depend on the pitch and gain of the current note, which are themselves dependant on the mouse pointer position.

You can [view the demo](http://mdn.github.io/violent-theremin/) live here.
